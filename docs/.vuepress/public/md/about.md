I am an undergraduate student majoring in Geospatial Information Engineering, and I am currently learning WebGIS related technologies.  


Current research interests are mainly GIS open source technology, spatial database, web graphics technology and their development in the field of GIS.


Looking forward to the development of WebGPU graphics technology, and I believe that in the future, it will not only bring a great improvement to the performance of Web graphics, but also promote the development of WebGIS.
